# Kickstarting with Excel
## Analysis of Theatre Kickstarter Projects
### The purpose of this project is to draw a comparison of the Outcomes of Theatre Kickstarters based on Launch Month. 
## Analysis and Challenges 
### By comparing the theatre kickstarter outcomes based on the launch dates, we see that there is an upward trajectory from January with a peak in May. Meaning, the theatre kickstarts were the most successful in the month of May. In May, we also see the largest gap between successful kickstarter projects and failed projects. After May, there is an overall decline in successful kickstarters. Theater projects launched in December were the least successful, with close to half of the projects resulting in being unsuccessful. When looking at the theatre projects that failed, the chart illustrates that the number of failed kickstarter projects does not fluctuate nearly as much as it does for successful kickstarter projects, staying either above or below the 40 line. Similarly, the number of canceled projects stays consistent by month, no more than a handful of canceled kickstarter projects by month. 
### When comparing Outcome Based on on Goals, there is a steady decrease in the percentage of successful projects as the fundraiser goal increases. However, projects with fundraising goals between $25,000 to $44,999 see a steady increase, peaking again at $40000-$45000. After this, we see a downward trajectory in percentage of successful kickstarters when the goals increase. 
### The first challenge that arises when looking at the Outcomes based on launch date graph is that, the graph accounts for raw data. This graph shows us the actual number of successful vs unsuccessful theatre kickstarters based on launch dates. This graphic can be misleading as May is seeing as the most successful month to launch a theatre kickstarter but it is also the month with the highest number of theatre kickstarters launched. Contrary, December has the lowest number of successful kickstarters but it was also the month were the least amount of theatre kickstarted were launched. An additional graph showing percentages of successful vs unsuccessful theatre kickstarter projects would be beneficial when analysisinp this data. Another challenge that we can see when looking at the outcomes of kickstarters based on goal is that there is a slight increase in the successful rate of kickstarters with goals of $25,000- $44999. It would be beneficial to further analyze these particular kickstarters and try to identify	any trends in kickstarters with this funding goal. 

## Results
### The first conclusion that can be drawn from the theatre based on launch date graph is that projects launched in May are the most successful with June and July also have a high number of successful theater kickstarters. Projects launched in December are the least likely to be successfully funded. 
### A conclusion that can be drawn from the Outcomes based on Goal graph is that projects have an over 70% chance of being successfully funded if the project goal is under $5000. Projects with goals of over $45,000 rarely get fully funded.
### A limitation to the data is that we are looking at an overwhelming amount of theatre kickstarter projects so it is difficult to focus on more information. We are getting plays as a category but within plays, there is several categories. It might be helpful to break up the subcategory even further and looking at genres and seeing if certain genres see more success than others. Another limitation that we have, is that we look at launch dates and some months having more theatre kickstarters launching than others, it would be helpful to have some background on why that is. 
### An alternative graph that can be created are looking at percentage of successful theatre kickstarters based on the launch date. This would take into account the number of kickstarters launched by month and give us a better idea of what month is best to launch a kickstarter based on the percentage of successful kickstarters by month. When looking at the data outcomes based on goals, most kickstarters have goals under $5000. An alternative graph could just be focused on analyzing just these kickstarters and breaking down the information even further. Ex. The ranges could be in $500 intervals.
